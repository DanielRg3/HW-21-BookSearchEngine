# HomeWork #21 "Book Search Engine"

## About
In this project we will take as starter code a fully functional Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.

To complete the assignmente we need to :
- Set up anApollo Server to use GraphQl queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.
- Modif the exisitng authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.
- Create and Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server
- Deploy the application in Heroku with a MongoDB using MongoDB Atlas.
